# LMD Transformer

Here you can find `load_midi` which is the library for decoupling and loading 
the data in text event format, scripts to create the dataset and vocabularies,
and the vocabularies themselves for lmd-aligned (small) and lmd_matched.

There is also code and notebooks to train models in Google Colab (using [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)).
